        <p>My hobby is reading intresting and knowledgeable books in my free time. Whenever I go to home from my school I like to read such books after completing my home work. I am 10 years old and read in class 5th standard. Now I know very well that reading is very good habit which can make me a complete. This hobby can be developed by anyone however I got this naturally. Reading books keeps one always happy and busy. It is the good source for enjoyment, knowledge, inspiration and instruction. It makes us diciplined, loyal, punctual and most importantly a successful person in the life.</p>
